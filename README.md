#In this Project we identified 11 topics using NIH Covid19 portfolio's abstracts,and title dataset. 
For topic modeling we used Gensim LDA, Mallet LDA, document similarity analysis using TF-IDF vectors, Top2Vec Model, UMAP, HDBSCAN. We also used Spearman correlation to see if there was any correlation between titles and abstracts. 

#All the notebooks are using Python 3 environment.
We ran the notebooks on cheaha and kaggle.
